# Transfer learning and multi-task
[Ref](https://teaching.pages.centralesupelec.fr/deeplearning-lectures-build/01-pytorch-object-detection.html)

We will use Resnet-18 as a backbone, add several blocks to form a model that classifies and detects several objects in a picture.

### Data preparation
We will use [Pascal VOC data set](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.8/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.VOCDetection)

## Transfer learning
